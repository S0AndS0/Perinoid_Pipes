> The `Code Climate` is an over all *grade* of both code **&** documentation found

## Project goals (generalized)

### Provide asymmetric encryption via GnuPG to logging services and local users

> See [Paranoid_Pipes_Scenario_One.md](Documentation/Paranoid_Pipes_Scenario_One.md)
> for detailed instructions on how to set this up for Nginx or Apache2 web
> server logging. See further documentation that include the word `Scenario` for
> other applications that this project maybe applied to easily.

### Provide template(s) of script-able interactions that use GnuPG

> See [ReadMe.md](Documentation/ReadMe.md) file under the `Documentation/`
> directory to find further listed examples as well as *helper* scripts found
> under [`Script_Helpers`](Script_Helpers) that enable more features of this
> project.
