## Required for apt-get commands within '.travis-ci/before_install_depends.sh'
##  & cp commands within '.travis-ci/install.sh' only, everything else should
##  be runing as "${USER}" for build processes.

## Custom setup prior to testing project, install dependencies & configure
##  The first installs dependancies via apt-get and uses sudo/root level
##  permissions, this should be the only build script that requires them.
before_install:
 - chmod +x .travis-ci/before_install_depends.sh
 - .travis-ci/before_install_depends.sh
## Steps for successful install once dependencies are met. Simply copies the
##  main script of this project to common install path and runs '--help'
##  command line option against it. Currently passing and operating correctly.
install:
 - chmod +x .travis-ci/install.sh
 - .travis-ci/install.sh
## Steps to complete prior to running further tests.
##  The first sets up temperary passphrase file as well as GPG key pare.
##  The second test the new key pare by encrypting a string as well as
##  decrypting the test string and reporting on if the decrypted file contence
##  matches the original test string. Currently all are passing and operating
##  corectly.
before_script:
 - chmod +x .travis-ci/before_script_gen_key.sh
 - .travis-ci/before_script_gen_key.sh
## - Run version two of main script encryption/decryption tests
##  this effectivly bundles both main script and decryption
##  helper script operations into one script that can do either.
script:
 - chmod u+x .travis-ci/version_two_tests.sh
 - .travis-ci/version_two_tests.sh
 - chmod u+x .travis-ci/version_two_second_tests.sh
 - .travis-ci/version_two_second_tests.sh
## Setps to complete after success or falure
## - Run version two script with padding and/or other experomental options
after_success:
 - chmod u+x .travis-ci/version_two_last_tests.sh
 - .travis-ci/version_two_last_tests.sh
