## Project goals (generalized)

### Provide automated encryption & decryption via GnuPG to logging services & users

> See [Paranoid_Pipes_Scenario_One.md](Documentation/Paranoid_Pipes_Scenario_One.md)
> for detailed instructions on how to set this up for Nginx or Apache2 web
> server logging. See further documentation that include the word `Scenario` for
> other applications that this project maybe applied to easily.

### Provide template(s) of script-able interactions that use GnuPG

> See [Documentation/ReadMe.md](Documentation/ReadMe.md) file to find further
> listed examples as well as *helper* scripts found
> under [`Script_Helpers`](Script_Helpers) that enable more features of this
> project or help setup this project for contribution.

### The core ideals held within this script's design

> Your data should be yours and only those you have authorized to access it
> should be allowed access. Furthermore, your data should be unreadable to
> those that do gain unauthorized access.
