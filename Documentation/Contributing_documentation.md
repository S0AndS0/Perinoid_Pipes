# Contributing to documentation

> This file assumes that you've already followed directions found within
> the [Contributing_code_initial_setup.md](Contributing_code_initial_setup.md)
> file. This file contains information specific to how these docs are formatted
> and how new documents should be formatted prior to using `pull-request` or
> `request-pull` commands with `git`. These guidelines are set in place to
> insure that all new and current documents for this project are formatted
> similarly.

## General formatting

> All files within the [`../Documentation/`](../Documentation/) directory should
> have no line other than code blocks that exceed 80 to 90 characters or columns.
> The easiest way to ensure that your additions are within this range try
> `echo "${COLUMNS}"` within your terminal window to check what it's current size
> is set at. Using `vim` and/or `nano` is encouraged when editing these documents
> but so long as your text editor does not mangle new-lines and your additions
> attempt to adhere to the following guidelines then singed pull requests are
> most welcomed.

## Formatting code examples

> Code examples generally should be placed in new-line separated *blocks* of
> text, bellow is an example.

```
# This block of text is easy to select
# and new lines are preserved when
# rendered in client browsers.
```

> The above uses three backticks (```x3) directly before and after a block of
> code. Bellow is above with the backticks exposed and added hashes to insure
> that the markdown rendering does not get confused.

```
#```
## This block of text is easy to select
## and new lines are preserved when
## rendered in client browsers.
#```
```

> Note within blocks of text that reference a line within a code block should
> use single backticks (````) to encapsulate the word or string referenced. For
> example if one where to reference the third line above for some informational
> reason it would look like; `# rendered in client browsers.` within a text block.

## Formatting text blocks

> Aside from rare occasions this project uses `>` to prefix the first line of
> a block of text that readers should read and uses blank new-lines to separate
> paragraphs.

For text that should pop-out to readers but not be **bold** then excluding the
 `>` (greater-than) symbol is fine.

> Text blocks that span more that 80 characters/columns in length  should be
> split onto separate lines with the space between words appearing on the next
> line.

Example of above in `raw` format

```
> Text blocks that span more that 80 characters/columns in length  should be
> split onto separate lines with the space between words appearing on the next
> line.
```

## Formatting headings

### Formatting for title of document

# Uses a single `#` at the beginning of lines

```
# Uses a single `#` at the beginning of lines
```

### Formatting sub-sections

## Uses double `##` at the beginning of lines

```
## Uses double `##` at the beginning of lines
```

### Formatting sub-sub-sections

### Uses triple `###` at the beginning of lines

```
### Uses triple `###` at the beginning of lines
```

This pattern should continue to ensure that readers of both `raw` formatted text
 and the markdown formatted text can visually see where in the document they are.

## Formatting lists

> There are two options with markdown formatted text, one is to use symbols
> prefixed by a space (` `) such as ` -` or ` +` to prefix *bulleted* listed
> lines, and two is to use numbers ` 1.`, ` 2.`, ... However, note that to use
> both simultaneously we'll have to *cheat* a bit and remove the prefixed space
> from the numbered list. Bellow are some examples along with their `raw`
> formated versions bellow each.

### Formatting bulleted lists

- First line
- Second line
- Third line

```
- First line
- Second line
- Third line
```

> Note using bulleted lists allow for lines to be re-ordered latter without
> effecting formatting.

### Formatting numbered lists (example one)

1. Number one
2. Number two
3. Number three

```
1. Number one
2. Number two
3. Number three
```

> Note the above using markdown could also be re-ordered but the `raw`
> formatting would look out of order until edited.

### Formatting numbered lists (example two)

2. Number one
3. Number two
1. Number three

```
2. Number one
3. Number two
1. Number three
```

> As stated in the previous example, markdown rendering should handle
> *quick'n'dirty* re-ordering of numbered lists, but the `raw` formatting exposes
> that the original order was changed.

### Formatting numbered lists (example three)

> Occasionally there is cause to combine both bulleted lists and numbered,
> however, doing this will disable the markdown recognition of numbers so
> `example two` above will no longer apply.

1. Number one
 - First line
 - Second line
 - Third line
2. Number two
 - First line
 - Second line
 - Third line
3. Number three
 - First line
 - Second line
 - Third line

```
1. Number one
 - First line
 - Second line
 - Third line
2. Number two
 - First line
 - Second line
 - Third line
3. Number three
 - First line
 - Second line
 - Third line
```

> Note also in above's `raw` formatting how an empty space was needed (` `)
> to insure that each numbered entry remains on it's own line once rendered.
