<h2 id="q-what-is-this-project">Q: What is this project</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A: This project aims to expose encryption operations (currently via GnuPG’s
PGP encryption applications) to logging daemons and/or user processes.
Being designed as a <em>cyber defense</em> tool for server administrators and
privacy concerned users of mobile devices, that wish for one more line of
defiance against privacy violating attacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="q-why-was-this-project-built">Q: Why was this project built</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A: Encryption of arbitrary data or files is a common enough request that this
tool was developed. This is not a partition encryption solution (often LUKS
partitions are the <em>goto</em> for such Kernel level supported encryption where a
file system can be mounted, read, and written to) instead this is a method of
file by file and/or line by line encryption at the host OS’s software layer
that can either be saved to an appended file or sent to another process as a
stream of encrypted data packets via another named pipe or service listening
to the main script’s stout.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="q-what-does-this-encryption-scripted-tool-set-do-for-me">Q: What does this encryption scripted tool set do for me</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A: When properly implemented this project aims to reduce risks associated
with remote server exploits leading to secondary attacks being easily carried
out on that server’s clients or admins by parsing plane text logs or other
information that the server host contains that should not be available to
unauthorized clients. Alternatively when properly implemented this project
aims to make authorized access to encrypted logs a simple process. However,
depending upon your inventiveness this project is capable of much more.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="q-how-is-the-code-checked-for-bugs">Q: How is the code checked for bugs</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A: Both locally and remotely this repository is checked via a wonderful
program, <code class="highlighter-rouge">shellcheck</code>, remote tests are facilitate via <a href="https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/shellcheck">CodeClimate.com</a>
which is also how this project receives updated <em>badges</em> on the
main <a href="../ReadMe.md">../ReadMe.md</a> file. Note local checks when passed will <em>bump</em>
the main script’s sub-version and remote checks, auto-buils, are facilitated
by <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis-CI</a> you may click on the <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">Badges</code></em> on the
main <a href="../ReadMe.md">../ReadMe.md</a> file of this project to view build histories.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="q-how-do-i-checkout-a-previously-working-build">Q: How do I checkout a previously working build</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A: Use the following steps for reverting your current working branch to a
previous build step</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>git log --oneline
##... output example beguin
549623a Yet more attempts at fixes
##... output example end
</code></pre>
</div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Find the commit ID, for this example we’ll be using the above <code class="highlighter-rouge">549623a</code> ID from
above to revert to.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout 549623a
</code></pre>
</div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Check the status and differences with the following to ensure that changes
reverted are those that are wanted.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>git status
git diff
</code></pre>
</div>

<blockquote>
  <p>To find working vs non-working builds check the build
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/S0AndS0/Perinoid_Pipes/builds">History</a> provided by
Travis-CI which will display compatible commit IDs to <code class="highlighter-rouge">checkout</code> to.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="q-how-do-i-find-differances-in-commits">Q: How do I find differances in commits</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A: Thankfully <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> makes this simple enough to accomplish between branches
and commited changes</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>## Git diff from un-commited changes
git diff
## Git diff from last commit
git diff $(git log | grep commit | head -n2 | tail -n1 | awk '{print $2}')
## Git diff between branches
git diff master..branch_name
</code></pre>
</div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note if mutliple files changed within one commit, for example the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ReadMe.md</code>
file, the following example commands will show how to reviel changes on single
files for each of the above</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>## Git diff from un-commited changes
git diff ReadMe.md
## Git diff from last commit
git diff $(git log | grep commit | head -n2 | tail -n1 | awk '{print $2}') ReadMe.md
## Git diff between branches
git diff master..branch_name ReadMe.md
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="q-do-i-need-this-projects-services">Q: Do I <em>need</em> this project’s services</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A: Are you a privacy conserned individual? Are you a sys-admin that must for
some business reason handle information that should be restricted or
confidential in some way? If <code class="highlighter-rouge">no</code> to either then you’ll not likely need this
project’s services just yet. So far as the authors of this project can find
evidence for, very few attacks escalate to the point that this project could
be considered useful or <em>needed</em>. That said, based off the speed at which
attacks are evolving, a tool like this may one day be the only thing left
denying unauthorized access to a successful attacker. Else if <code class="highlighter-rouge">yes</code> consider
this tool as an option (if GnuPG is allowed to you) that maybe used as yet
another layer within your security modal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="q-what-do-you-mean-by-if-gnupg-is-allowed-to-you-statement-above">Q: What do you mean by, if GnuPG is allowed to you, statement above</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A: The authors of this project are not <em>experts</em> in happenings of
international  <em>legalieze</em>, nor should you consider this advice within that
realm, to put it simply; look up the laws of your own region in relation to
the use of GnuPG. If you’re allowed to use GnuPG then there’s no restrictions
as far as the authors of this project could find for use with this project
on authorize hardware. However, if your within a region that can’t make use
of GnuPG then the authors would ask that you refrain from import for now.
Note, this notice was added do to the recent activity on privacy <em>canneries</em>
warning this projects’ core authors of confidentiality violation reports being
generated by third parties accessing what they where not authorized to access.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="q-what-does-project-abandonment-mean">Q: What does “project abandonment” mean</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A: You must have seen the licensing modification on the forums that this
project’s core authors has advertised it’s self on. In short it means at any
point in the future (unless a signed message fitting this project’s core
author’s writing style is posted there) that this project may have it’s
licensing for documentation modified such that certain things no longer need
be included in derivative works. Abandonment as defined by that authorized
post is any time longer than ninety six (96) hours after the last signed
push by core authors to this project’s public code repository. This is to
guaranty further <em>freedoms</em> of this project are implemented if at some
point in the future this project’s core authors either finish work on it or
are no longer able to work on this project. This does <strong>not</strong> mean that the
core authors of this project <em>plan</em> on abandoning this project, only that
they’ve, as fully as possible, planed for events that may cause core authors
to no longer be able to maintain this current project’s code or documentation.</p>
