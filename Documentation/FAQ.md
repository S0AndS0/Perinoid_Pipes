# What is this project? (F.A.Q.)

 - Q: What is this project?

 > A: This project aims to expose asymmetric encryption operations (currently
 via GnuPG's PGP encryption applications) to logging daemons and/or user
 processes. Being designed as a *cyber defense* tool for server administrators
 and privacy concerned users of mobile devices, that wish for one more line of
 defiance against privacy violating 0-day attacks.

 - Q: What does this asymmetric encryption stuff do for me?

 > A: When properly implemented this project aims to reduce risks associated
 with remote server exploits leading to secondary attacks being easily carried
 out on that server's clients or admins by parsing plane text logs.
 Alternatively when properly implemented this project aims to make authorized
 access to encrypted logs a simple process. However, depending upon your
 inventiveness this project is capable of much more.

 - Q: Do I *need* this?

 > A: If you are a server administrator or perhaps a reporter in lands
 un-friendly to "*freedom* of press" then consider this project as yet another
 tool to use for frustrating would be attackers of your servers or
 journalistic freedoms. Otherwise you likely do not need this project's
 services, the authors will acknowledge that the core goals of this project
 are not needed my a majority of networked users and/or admins... not yet any
 ways. However if you find a new usage for this project the authors would
 certainly enjoy knowing how you've found a need for this.
