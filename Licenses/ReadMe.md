# Licensing explained

The authors of this project believe that the above two licenses are the most
 compatible with preexisting documentation and code examples most similar to
 this project and logic used by it's operations. While it may seem like a lot
 of *red tape* for code contributers to have to go through the above licenses
 enable all authors and users of this project to make use of and modify as
 *freely* as possible. Thus these above two licenses will apply for all current
 and new documentation & code within this project to preserve these freedoms
 for all current and new users of this project.

See the [`Documentation/`](../Documentation) directory within this project for
 more information on contributing to this project and using it within various
 usage scenarios already predicted by authors.
