# Frequently (and perhaps infrequently) asked question (F.A.Q.)

## Q: How is the code checked for bugs

> A: Both locally and remotely this repository is checked via a wonderful
> program, `shellcheck`, remote tests are facilitate via
> [CodeClimate.com](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/shellcheck) which is also
> how this project receives updated *badges* on the main
> [ReadMe.md](../ReadMe.md) file.

## Q: What is this project

> A: This project aims to expose asymmetric encryption operations (currently
> via GnuPG's PGP encryption applications) to logging daemons and/or user
> processes. Being designed as a *cyber defense* tool for server administrators
> and privacy concerned users of mobile devices, that wish for one more line of
> defiance against privacy violating 0-day attacks.

## Q: What does this asymmetric encryption stuff do for me

> A: When properly implemented this project aims to reduce risks associated
> with remote server exploits leading to secondary attacks being easily carried
> out on that server's clients or admins by parsing plane text logs.
> Alternatively when properly implemented this project aims to make authorized
> access to encrypted logs a simple process. However, depending upon your
> inventiveness this project is capable of much more.

## Q: Do I *need* this

> A: If you are a server administrator or perhaps a reporter in lands
> unfriendly to "*freedom* of press" then consider this project as yet another
> tool to use for frustrating would be attackers of your servers or
> journalistic freedoms. Otherwise you likely do not need this project's
> services, the authors will acknowledge that the core goals of this project
> are not needed my a majority of networked users and/or admins... not yet any
> ways. However if you find a new usage for this project the authors would
> certainly enjoy knowing how you've found a need for this.
