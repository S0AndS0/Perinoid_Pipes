## Searching within file, hint `/` is our friend in `vim`

```
/search_string
```

> Note: entering `/` and then pressing `[up]` arrow key on your keyboard will
> show the last search string input, pressing `[up]` arrow key will continue
> scrolling through the history of previously entered search strings.

## Interactive editing

```
i                        # Insert mode
```

## Exiting interactive editing mode

```
[Esc]                    # Exit insert mode
```

> Note above `[Esc]` literally means pressing your keyboard's escape key.

## Spell checking

- Option 1; spell checking for US region English for all documents

```
echo 'set spell spelllang=en_us' | tee -a ~/.vimrc
```

- Option 2; spell checking from within vim edit session

```
:setlocal spell spelllang=en_us
```

> Note `Option 1` writes to your current user's `.vimrc` file which unless
> edited becomes a *permanent* `vim` setting for enabling spell checking on any
> document opened by `vim` at a latter time. Where as `Option 2` is a temporary
> setting; only applies within current `vim` session. To turn off spell checking
> temporally within a document editing session use `:set nospell`

## Navigating spell checking short cuts

```
[s                       # Move to previous miss-spelled word.
]s                       # Move to next miss-spelled word.
```

## Selecting auto spell check suggestions

```
z=                       # Open vim menu of numbered suggestions
```

> Above opens an interactive menu, press `[Enter]` to exit the menu without
> changes, or select a number prior to pressing `[Enter]` to select a suggestion
> and replace the miss-spelled word.

## Adding words to `vim` dictionary & marking words as miss-spelled

```
zg                       # Saves selected word as correct for local dictionary.
zw                       # Mark selected word as miss-spelled.
```

## Turn off spell corrections within current `vim` session

```
:set nospell
```

## Saving changes

```
:wqa                     # Write All changes and quit
```

## Quiting without changes

```
:cq                      # Cancel and quit
```
